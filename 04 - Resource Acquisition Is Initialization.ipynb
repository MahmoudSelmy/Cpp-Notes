    "# Resource Acquisition Is Initialization or RAII\n",
    "\n",
    "is a C++ programming technique which binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the lifetime of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAII can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- encapsulate each resource into a class, where\n",
    "  - the constructor acquires the resource and establishes all class invariants or throws an exception if that cannot be done,\n",
    "  - the destructor releases the resource and never throws exceptions;\n",
    "- always use the resource via an instance of a RAII-class that either\n",
    "  - has automatic storage duration or temporary lifetime itself, or\n",
    "  - has lifetime that is bounded by the lifetime of an automatic or temporary object"
