    "# The Monitor Object Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "One important step towards such a construct is to implement a monitor object, which is a design pattern that synchronizes concurrent method execution to ensure that only one method at a time runs within an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also allows an object's methods to cooperatively schedule their execution sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem solved by this pattern is based on the observation that many applications contain objects whose methods are invoked concurrently by multiple client threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These methods often modify the state of their objects, for example by adding data to an internal vector\n",
    "  - For such concurrent programs to execute correctly, it is necessary to synchronize and schedule access to the objects very carefully."
