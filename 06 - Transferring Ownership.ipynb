    "With return values, the same logic that we have used for passing smart pointers to functions applies: Return a smart pointer, both unique or shared, if the caller needs to manipulate or access the pointer properties. In case the caller just needs the underlying object, a raw pointer should be returned.\n",

    "Smart pointers should always be returned by value. This is not only simpler but also has the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overhead usually associated with return-by-value due to the expensive copying process is significantly mitigated by the built-in move semantics of smart pointers. They only hold a reference to the managed object, which is quickly switched from destination to source during the move process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since C++17, the compiler used Return Value Optimization (RVO) to avoid the copy usually associated with return-by-value. This technique, together with copy-elision, is able to optimize even move semantics and smart pointers (not in call cases though, they are still an essential part of modern C++).\n",
    "\n",
    "- When returning a shared_ptr by value, the internal reference counter is guaranteed to be properly incremented. This is not the case when returning by pointer or by reference."
